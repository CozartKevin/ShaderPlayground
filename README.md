# ShaderPlayground
Welcome to the **ShaderPlayground** repository!  This repository is dedicated to exploring and experimenting with various graphics shaders, built with OpenGL and C++.

## Project Overview:
- **ShaderDemos**: Basic shader demonstations such as vertex shaders and color gradients.
- **Lighting**: Exploration of different lighting models, including Phong Lighting and shadow mapping.
- **ProceduralTextures**: Implementing procedural texture generation algorithms such as checkerboards and Perlin noise. 

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CozartKevin/ShaderPlayground 

2. Set up dependencies (e.g., OpenGL, CMake).
3. Navigate to a specific project folder and follow its individual 'README.md' for setup and usage instructions.
